# README.md
🎓 I am a passionate Computer Science student at Minnesota State University, with an expected graduation in May 2026.

🚀 My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in various domains, including Data Structures, Algorithms Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Statistics, and Bioinformatics.

🔍 Currently exploring the realms of Natural Language Processing(NLP), Data Visualization, and mainly Machine Learning.

📜 Certified in Fundamentals of Data Science in Precision Medicine and Cloud Computing from Stanford University, Python from the University of Michigan, and Web Creation Series (HTML5 and CSS) from Indiana University.

👨‍💻 My skills include proficiency in Python, Java, R, and HTML/CSS. I'm well-versed in frameworks such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, and Seaborn.

🔬 In my projects, I've developed an Early Infection Detection System using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This involved implementing real-time alerting systems to detect infectious diseases and stressors early.

👁️‍🗨️ Additionally, I've delved into Computer Vision Image Classification using Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas. I optimized models for speed and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results on digits and sign language hand signals. This led to the development of a real-world application—a sign language translator.
